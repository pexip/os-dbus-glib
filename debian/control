Description: deprecated library for D-Bus IPC
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides a deprecated GLib-based shared library for
 applications using the GLib interface to D-Bus. New code should use
 GDBus, part of GLib, instead.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

 This package provides development files for a deprecated GLib-based
 D-Bus library. New code should use GDBus, part of GLib, instead.

Description: deprecated library for D-Bus IPC (development tools)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package is an implementation detail of libdbus-glib-1-dev and
 should not be depended on directly. It provides the dbus-binding-tool,
 used to generate code for a deprecated GLib-based D-Bus library. New
 code should use GDBus, part of GLib, instead.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.
